# What drives me?
The thrill of learning something new and being able to use it to solve a problem. 

*For eg. yesterday I learnt how to upload images to a website, using a `Node` package and just use the URL in this presentation*




# What are we trying to do


# Learn
- What is it?
- How does that happen? 


> Learning results from what the student does and thinks and only from what the student does and thinks. The teacher can advance learning only by influencing what the student does to learn.
> - HERBERT A. SIMON, Founder of the field of Cognitive Science


## We are trying to make sure that you "the" student is able to 
- do stuff and 
- think things




##Principles of Learning (My version)
Just so you remember this while learning


# Your prior knowledge can help or hinder learning


# How you organise knowledge influences how you will learn and *apply*


# Your motivation plays a crucial role


## To develop mastery, you must 
1. acquire various skills, 
2. practice integrating them and 
3. most importantly know when to apply what you have learned
 


# Always do Goal directed practice


## To become self directed learner, you must 
- learn to monitor and 
- adjust your approach to learning




# How do we know where we are?
Unless you know where you are starting, there is no way for you to measure where you are going or how much of the way is done


# Step 1 - Create your skill chart


# We can't do this in isolation
- There is no way to figure out how much we need to learn in isolation
- This is best done as a group activity




# Group Activity
Lets divide the room in 4 sections 
1. Beginners
2. Intermediate
3. Expert
4. Neo


# Lets make a list of all the things that we should know 
And we should categorise them

## How do we get to where we want to go?
We break down the topic we want to learn in two main parts
1. Skills required
2. Knowledge to be gained (Application of skills to solve a problem)



## Group Activity 
1. Pick a topic
2. Make a list of skills required for that skill
3. Add this to the practice workbench


# Setup a workbench online

# Setup a Roadmap
![](http://res.cloudinary.com/makash/image/upload/v1484971294/k4jl3xlixt1sblerxurx.png)


# For now we will just focus on timeline
- How does one setup a timeline?
- Where should we setup a timeline?


# Setup a Calendar (Google?)
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/makash/image/upload/v1484963692/xyvk2ilygon0happtfip.png)



# How will I remember everything?
- Use markdown for documentation 
- Use raneto / mkdocs for personal website 


## Setup Raneto
1. Download Raneto (http://raneto.com/)
2. Unzip it 
3. Run the command `npm install` (node needs to be installed)
4. Now `npm start` to start it on http://localhost:3000


## Configure Raneto to use as a knowledge base
1. Change directory to `cd example/content`
2. Add a new directory `mkdir my-new-security-project`
3. Create a new markdown document 
4. Add content
5. Browse to http://localhost:3000



## (Alterantive) Setup and Configure Mkdocs
1. install mkdocs
`pip install mkdocs`
2. configure mkdocs
`mkdocs new my-project`
KnowledgeBase Location `my-project\docs`
3. Serving the content
`cd my-project\mkdocs serve`
4. Browse at http://localhost:8000

Change in markdown file results in automatic rebuild of the knowledgebase and refresh of the page.

[More details and Advance setup information here](http://www.mkdocs.org/)


# Tip
> Add the entire directory of Raneto under version control and set a remote repository to a private bitbucket / gitlab repository

# What about my research? 
Use Google Keep


![Google Keep](https://res.cloudinary.com/makash/image/upload/v1484972972/keep_pjuti9.png)


![Label the notes as per our roadmap categories](https://res.cloudinary.com/makash/image/upload/v1484973038/Screen_Shot_2017-01-21_at_10.00.13_mbugrf.png)




# How will I collaborate with others?
- Use version control and issues and wikis
- Use Raneto in a repository together with collaborators


# How should I seek help? 
- Ask 
    - Keeping in mind [How to ask questions in the smart way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)
- Mailing lists 
    - null
    - Cysinfo
    - OWASP


# How can I make full use of the community?
- Ask for sessions
- Keep reminding the chapter leaders
    + If the leaders aren't responding, volunteer to become one
- Do all workbench activities in groups
    + You will cover more ground faster




# Managing your time and priorities 
Label all tasks with the following four 
1. Important and not Urgent
2. Urgent and not Important
3. Important and Urgent
4. Not Important and Not Urgent


## Focus on 
Important and not urgent


## Always try to delegate
Not Important and Not Urgent


## Set reminders for 
Urgent and not Important


## 5 Questions to ask always
- Why?
- What?
- How?
- When?  
- Where? 


# Yes and No Questions 


## Are you leaving the talk with a generic roadmap based on where you are in the journey


## Do you have a new language to understand and measure?


## Did you find that there are others in the same place as you and you are all in this together? 


## Did you realise that the community can provide multiple ways to get people together to collaborate and learn


## Are you leaving the talk with some clarity on where you are headed?
